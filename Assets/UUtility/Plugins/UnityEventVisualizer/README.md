<h2>What</h2>
Have you ever come across a project that abuses linking <b>UnityEvents</b> in the inspector and now you can not find who is calling what?
<b>Unity Event Visualizer</b> is a visual tool that allows you to see all the UnityEvents in a scene at a glance and when they are being triggered. It creates a graph in which nodes are <b>gameobjects</b>, outputs are any type of UnityEvent (custom ones supported as well!) and inputs are methods.

- Select any root gameobject(s) and click on ```Rebuild on selected hierarchy``` to generate a graph
of all events being fired by the selected hierarchy, or  ```Rebuild JUST selected``` to generate a

click any of the buttons to generate the graph of the entire scene, but beware for massive graphs!



- Click on any node to highlight that <b>gameobjects</b> in your hiearchy. 
Alternatively right-click on any element in the hierarchy and select ```UnityEventGraph/FindThis``` 
to highlight it in the graph. Or ```UnityEventGraph/Graph Just This``` and  ```UnityEventGraph/Graph This Hierarchy``` 
in order to create a graph starting just in this gameobject or any of its children respectively.
